## Lecture 1 Incidence and Etiology of Cancer
### 1.1 Cancer Terms and Definitions
* Uncontroled Growth
* Tumor
* Neoplasm
    * A new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of body
* Oncology
* Metastasis: refers to the spreading of cancer from a primary site to distant organs

### 1.2 Where Does Cancer Start?
* Cancers are classified according to the tissue where they originate
* There are four main types
    * Carcinoma: Arise in epithelial tissue that is found in the internal and external lining of the body
        * Adenocarcinomas develop in an organ or gland
        * Squamous cell carcinomas develop in the squamous epithelium of organs, including the skin, bladder, esophagus, and lung
    * Sarcoma: Arise from connective tissue that is found in bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat
    * Leukemia: Cancers of the blood that originate in the bone marrow
    * Lymphoma: Cancers of the lymph system

### 1.3 The Common Cancers
* Lung Cancer
    * 85% lung cancers are non-small-cell cancers(NSCLC)
        * Squamous cell carcinoma (25%)
        * Large-cell carcinoma (10%)
        * Adenocarcinoma (40%)

* Colon Cancer
    * Risk Factors
        * Age
        * Diet: High in red meats, low in vegetables (Low Fiber Diet)
        * Lifestyle: Obesity, smoking, alcohol
        * Inflammatory bowel disease
        * +Family History: Appoximately double with one affected first-degree relative
        * Genes: DNA repair; APC, KRAS, TP53

        * Diet: High in red meat, low in vegetables

    * Prostate Cancer Screening
        * Prostate-Specific Antigen(PSA) blood tests with a health provider

* The Liver
    * Hard to detect
    * Risk Factors
        * Sex: Approximately twice as in men
        * Chronic Viral Hepatitis
        * Alcohol
        * Aflatoxins: Fungus associated with strong grains in tropical environments
        * Lifestyle

* The Stomach Cancer
    * Sex: Approximately twice as common in men
    * Age
    * H. pylori: Chronic infection with this bacteria appears to cause stomach cancer
    * Diet: Smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled vegetables (high nitrates and nitrites)
    * Lifestyle: Obesity, smoking
    * Type A blood

## Lecture 2 Genetics of Cancer
### 2.1 Cancer Is a Genetic Disease
* What is a gene?
* A discrete unit of heredity of a living organism
* A region of DNA that encodes for a functional product(RNA or protein)
* Humans have ~25000 genes in the genome

### 2.2 DNA
* Deoxyhibonucleic Acid(DNA)
* Every time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA

</center>

* How Do Different Types of Cells Do Different Things?
    * Even though every cells has the same DNA, only a subset of genes are transcribed into RNA
    * Road :: DNA genes
    * Traffic Pattern :: gene expersion
    * Traffic Lights :: regulate what gens are transcribed to RNA in each cell - epigenetic regulation

### 2.3 Genetic Variation and Mutation
* Cancer is caused by accumulation of detrimental variation in the genome
* A single formation is not sufficient for mutation
* The vast majority of a genomes are the same person to person about 99.5%.
That remainder, 0.5%, is very variable in the human population. 
* This variation is very small, only one or
a few bases of the DNA vary at any particular location.
And those are known for polymorphisms or
single nucleotide polymorphisms also called SNPs. 

### 2.4 Mutation
* Oncogene: Low in Normal Cell, High in Cancer Cell

* Tumor Suppressor: High in Normal Cell, Low in Cancer Cell

### 2.5 Two-Hit Hypothesis
* You can acquire mutations two different ways,
either through somatic mutation or germline mutation. 

* Somatic Mutations: UV light; Smoke

* Germline Mutations: (aka inheritated mutations) are present in a germ cell (egg or sperm) and are inheritated by offspring - genetic variation we are born with.

* The biggest risk factor for developing cancer is aging - overtime, we accumulate mutations that arise by random replication error or by exposure to carcinogens that increase DNA damage(e.g, UV light, smoking, chemical exposure, etc.)

* Two-Hit Hypothesis
    * Reminder: Humans have two copied of every gene ("diploid") - one maternal, one paternal
    * Even if one copy(allele) of the gene is mutated, the other copy allows the protein to operate normally
    * For a gene to be cancer inducing, both copies of the gene must be affected. The second "hit" may alter the DNA(mutation) or alter the expression of the DNA(epigenetic).

* Cancer Risk: Inherited Mutation + Environment + Somatic Mutation

* Most Cancer Requires Mutatioins in Multiple Different Genes
    * To survive, a cancer cell must overcome normal regulation of:
        * Cell proliferation
        * Cell survival
        * Celluar communication
    * Each of these processes is tightly regulated in normal cells by redundant **pathways**
    * To become cancerous, a cell must accumulate mutations (minimum 6-7) in multiple different genes

* Mutation inactivates tumor suppressor gene --> Cells proliferate --> Mutation inactivates DNA repair gene --> Mutation of proto-oncogene creates an oncogene --> Mutation inactivates several more --> Cancer

### 2.6 Genomic Instability
* Cancer Cells Show Genomic Instability
    * Genimic instability: Can survive and divide with higher rates of mutation than normal cells
    * Normal cell: DNA replication error --> programed cell death
    * Cancer cell: DNA replication error --> cell continued to divide and passes mutation
    * As mutations in these repair pathways accumualte, the frequency of mutations in the cancer cell genome increase

## Lecture 3 The Human Cell and Hallmarks of Cancer
### 3.0 Term Used in This Module and Their Definitions
* Apoptosis: A form of programed cell death
* Mitosis: A form of cell division that results in two daughter cells
* Telomeres: Located at the ends of a chromosome, these have a specific sequence of nucleotides; shorten after each mitotic cycle
* Angiogenesis: The process of developing new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels
* Metastasis: The process by which cancer spreads from its origin to another part of the body

### 3.1 The Eukaryotic Cell
* The cell is the smallest functional unit of life that replicates independently
* This replication is called mitosis

### 3.2 Celluar Hallmark of Cancer Cells No.1: Replicative Immortality
* Normal human cells have a finite ablility to underggo mitosus due to the end replication problem
* This is largely due in part to ends of chromosomes(telomeres) shortening after each mitotic division
* Once normal human cells reach the Hayflick's limit, cells can go into celluar senescene
* Cancer cells are very different - they can greatly exceed "Hayfilck's limit" and continue to undergo mitosis
* Cancer cells are able to do this because they can elongate their telomeres using an enzyme called **telomerase**

### 3.3 Celluar Hallmark of Cancer Cells No.2: Genome Instability
* If a mutation is detected in a noraml cell undergoing DNA synthesis, the cycle will arrest and the mutation repaired before re-entering the cell cycle
* This is regulated by genes known as tumor suppressors
* Cancer cells are different and have an abnormal amount of chromosomes per cell and can bear mutations in their DNA with the ability to still undergo mitosis!
* Genes are mutated or lost are tumor suppressor genes(TSGs)
* Genes that get over-expressed are known as oncogenes, which cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably
