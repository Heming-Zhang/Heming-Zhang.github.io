## Lecture 1 Incidence and Etiology of Cancer
### 1.1 Cancer Terms and Definitions
* Uncontroled Growth
* Tumor
* Neoplasm
    * A new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of body
* Oncology
* Metastasis: refers to the spreading of cancer from a primary site to distant organs

### 1.2 Where Does Cancer Start?
* Cancers are classified according to the tissue where they originate
* There are four main types
    * Carcinoma: Arise in epithelial tissue that is found in the internal and external lining of the body
        * Adenocarcinomas develop in an organ or gland
        * Squamous cell carcinomas develop in the squamous epithelium of organs, including the skin, bladder, esophagus, and lung
    * Sarcoma: Arise from connective tissue that is found in bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat
    * Leukemia: Cancers of the blood that originate in the bone marrow
    * Lymphoma: Cancers of the lymph system

## Lecture 2 Genetics of Cancer
### 2.1 Cancer Is a Genetic Disease
* What is a gene?
* A discrete unit of heredity of a living organism
* A region of DNA that encodes for a functional product(RNA or protein)
* Humans have ~25000 genes in the genome

### 2.2 DNA
* Deoxyhibonucleic Acid(DNA)
* Every time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA

</center>

* How Do Different Types of Cells Do Different Things?
    * Even though every cells has the same DNA, only a subset of genes are transcribed into RNA
    * Road :: DNA genes
    * Traffic Pattern :: gene expersion
    * Traffic Lights :: regulate what gens are transcribed to RNA in each cell - epigenetic regulation

### 2.3 Genetic Variation and Mutation
* Cancer is caused by accumulation of detrimental variation in the genome
* A single formation is not sufficient for mutation
* The vast majority of a genomes are the same person to person about 99.5%.
That remainder, 0.5%, is very variable in the human population. 
* This variation is very small, only one or
a few bases of the DNA vary at any particular location.
And those are known for polymorphisms or
single nucleotide polymorphisms also called SNPs. 

### 2.4 Mutation
* Oncogene: Low in Normal Cell, High in Cancer Cell

* Tumor Suppressor: High in Normal Cell, Low in Cancer Cell

### 2.5 Two-Hit Hypothesis
* You can acquire mutations two different ways,
either through somatic mutation or germline mutation. 

* Somatic Mutations: UV light; Smoke

* Germline Mutations: (aka inheritated mutations) are present in a germ cell (egg or sperm) and are inheritated by offspring - genetic variation we are born with.

* The biggest risk factor for developing cancer is aging - overtime, we accumulate mutations that arise by random replication error or by exposure to carcinogens that increase DNA damage(e.g, UV light, smoking, chemical exposure, etc.)

* Two-Hit Hypothesis
    * Reminder: Humans have two copied of every gene ("diploid") - one maternal, one paternal
    * Even if one copy(allele) of the gene is mutated, the other copy allows the protein to operate normally
    * For a gene to be cancer inducing, both copies of the gene must be affected. The second "hit" may alter the DNA(mutation) or alter the expression of the DNA(epigenetic).

* Cancer Risk: Inherited Mutation + Environment + Somatic Mutation

* Most Cancer Requires Mutatioins in Multiple Different Genes
    * To survive, a cancer cell must overcome normal regulation of:
        * Cell proliferation
        * Cell survival
        * Celluar communication
    * Each of these processes is tightly regulated in normal cells by redundant **pathways**
    * To become cancerous, a cell must accumulate mutations (minimum 6-7) in multiple different genes

* Mutation inactivates tumor suppressor gene --> Cells proliferate --> Mutation inactivates DNA repair gene --> Mutation of proto-oncogene creates an oncogene --> Mutation inactivates several more --> Cancer

### 2.6 Genomic Instability
* Cancer Cells Show Genomic Instability
    * Genimic instability: Can survive and divide with higher rates of mutation than normal cells
    * Normal cell: DNA replication error --> programed cell death
    * Cancer cell: DNA replication error --> cell continued to divide and passes mutation
    * As mutations in these repair pathways accumualte, the frequency of mutations in the cancer cell genome increase

## Lecture 3 The Human Cell and Hallmarks of Cancer
### 3.0 Term Used in This Module and Their Definitions
* Apoptosis: A form of programed cell death
* Mitosis: A form of cell division that results in two daughter cells
* Telomeres: Located at the ends of a chromosome, these have a specific sequence of nucleotides; shorten after each mitotic cycle
* Angiogenesis: The process of developing new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels
* Metastasis: The process by which cancer spreads from its origin to another part of the body

### 3.1 The Eukaryotic Cell
* The cell is the smallest functional unit of life that replicates independently
* This replication is called mitosis

### 3.2 Hallmark No.1: Replicative Immortality
* Normal human cells have a finite ablility to underggo mitosus due to the end replication problem
* This is largely due in part to ends of chromosomes(telomeres) shortening after each mitotic division
* Once normal human cells reach the Hayflick's limit, cells can go into celluar senescene
* Cancer cells are very different - they can greatly exceed "Hayfilck's limit" and continue to undergo mitosis
* Cancer cells are able to do this because they can elongate their telomeres using an enzyme called **telomerase**

### 3.3 Hallmark No.2: Genome Instability
* If a mutation is detected in a noraml cell undergoing DNA synthesis, the cycle will arrest and the mutation repaired before re-entering the cell cycle
* This is regulated by genes known as tumor suppressors
* Cancer cells are different and have an abnormal amount of chromosomes per cell and can bear mutations in their DNA with the ability to still undergo mitosis!
* Genes are mutated or lost are tumor suppressor genes(TSGs)
* Genes that get over-expressed are known as oncogenes, which cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably
* Notable gene alternations observeed in cancer are point mutations, the deletion of regions of chromosomes, loss of heterozygosity(LOH), and several others.

### 3.4 Hallmark No.3: Evasion of Growth Suppressor Signals
* Mitosis in normal cells is a tightly controlled process where in the pro- and anti- proliferation signals coordinate cell activities at the cell cycle level
* However, due to Hallmark No.2(genomic instability), most cancer cells circumvent normal growth suppressor siganls in the G1 checkpoint in order to continue proliferating

</center>

* A TSG called retinoblastoma(Rb) inhibits the normal cell's passage through the restriction point in the G1 cell cycle phase
* Another TSG, p53, functions as a central regulator of cell death because it arrests the cell cycle upon detection of DNA damage

### 3.5 Hallmark No.4 Resistance to Cell Death
* Normal cells can initiate apoptosis(cell death) in response to abundant DNA damage and other celluar stresses
* In contrast, cancer cells are generally less sensitive to DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, treatments, and similar streesses, and so they tend to avoid apoptosis

</center>

* Resisting Cell Death by High Pro-Survival Proteins, Bcl-2
* In many cancer types, we see Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 family members particularly over expressed.

### 3.6 Hallmark No.5 Sustained Proliferation
* Within normal cells, growth factor siganling is also tightly controlled to allow for cellular and tissue homeostasis
* Cancer cells have the ability to prliferate due to the aforemetioned Hallmarks 1-4 as well as to over-active oncogenes such as RAS
* Cancer cells can also stimulate normal cells in the microenvironment to provide growth factors
* Epidermal Growth Factor(EGF)

</center>

### 3.7 Hallmark No.6 Altered Metabolism
* Normal cells break glucose down(glycolysis) to pyruvate which provides energy adenosine triphosphate(ATP) for the cell
* Cancer cells are very different - these cells can convert glucose to lactate irrespective of oxygen
* This allows the cancer cell to divert metabolites for useful anabolic processes such mitosis

### 3.8 Hallmark No.7 Avoid Immune Destruction
* Cells of the immune system that engulf and destroy foreign particles are B cells, T lymphocytes or T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. 
* Cancer cells can protect themselves by inhibiting T cells that would noramlly attack these cancer cells

### 3.9 Hallmark No.8 Tumor-Promoting Inflammation
* Immune cells provide the tumor cells with essential factors that allow them to survive, move, proliferate, and undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT) and invade


### 3.10 Hallmark No.9 Induction of Angiogenesis
* Pro-angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) become activated in tumor cells and signal endothelial cell proliferation and growth of blood vessels
* Immune infiltrating cells can also induce this

### 3.11 Hallmark No.10 Activation of Invasion and Metastasis
* Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are altered
* Changes in or loss of structrual proteins(e.g., intergins)
* Loss of genes known as metastasis suppressor genes(KAI1/CD82,NDRG1)
* Recruitment of immune cells
* Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT)

### 6.1 Surgery and Radiation
* Surgery removes the tumor
* Radiation can be given as external beam radiation or by implanting radioactive seeds into the tumor
* Killing dividing cells through DNA damage which leads to cell death.

### 6.2 Hormones
### 6.3 Chemotherapy
* Almost all chemotherapy drugs have been designed to keep cells from dividing.Cancer cells tend to divide more rapidly than normal cells, and therefore, they are more likely to die from chemotherapy treatment.
* Inhibiting replication of DNA
* Inhibiting cell division
* Inhibiting microtubules
