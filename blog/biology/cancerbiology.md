## Lecture 1 Incidence and Etiology of Cancer
### 1.1 Cancer Terms and Definitions
* Uncontroled Growth
* Tumor
* Neoplasm
    * A new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of body
* Oncology
* Metastasis: refers to the spreading of cancer from a primary site to distant organs

### 1.2 Where Does Cancer Start?
* Cancers are classified according to the tissue where they originate
* There are four main types
    * Carcinoma: Arise in epithelial tissue that is found in the internal and external lining of the body
        * Adenocarcinomas develop in an organ or gland
        * Squamous cell carcinomas develop in the squamous epithelium of organs, including the skin, bladder, esophagus, and lung
    * Sarcoma: Arise from connective tissue that is found in bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat
    * Leukemia: Cancers of the blood that originate in the bone marrow
    * Lymphoma: Cancers of the lymph system

### 1.3 The Common Cancers
* Lung Cancer
    * 85% lung cancers are non-small-cell cancers(NSCLC)
        * Squamous cell carcinoma (25%)
        * Large-cell carcinoma (10%)
        * Adenocarcinoma (40%)

* Colon Cancer
    * Risk Factors
        * Age
        * Diet: High in red meats, low in vegetables (Low Fiber Diet)
        * Lifestyle: Obesity, smoking, alcohol
        * Inflammatory bowel disease
        * +Family History: Appoximately double with one affected first-degree relative
        * Genes: DNA repair; APC, KRAS, TP53
    
    * Colon Cancer Prevention
        * High-fiber diet
        * Possibility: Low-dose aspirin

* Breast Cancer
    * Risk Factors
        * Age
        * +Family history
        * Genes: BRCA increases risk by 55-65%; BRCA2 increases risk by approximately 45%
        * Dense breast tissue
        * Lifestyle

* The Prostate
    * Risk Factors:
        * Age
        * Ethnicity: Higher in African American, lower in Asian men
        * +Famlily history
        * Genes: HoxB13; BRCA1,2; MSH2 and MSH1
        * Diet: High in red meat, low in vegetables

    * Prostate Cancer Screening
        * Prostate-Specific Antigen(PSA) blood tests with a health provider

* The Liver
    * Hard to detect
    * Risk Factors
        * Sex: Approximately twice as in men
        * Chronic Viral Hepatitis
        * Alcohol
        * Aflatoxins: Fungus associated with strong grains in tropical environments
        * Lifestyle

* The Stomach Cancer
    * Sex: Approximately twice as common in men
    * Age
    * H. pylori: Chronic infection with this bacteria appears to cause stomach cancer
    * Diet: Smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled vegetables (high nitrates and nitrites)
    * Lifestyle: Obesity, smoking
    * Type A blood
