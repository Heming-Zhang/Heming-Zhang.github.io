## Recommended Books

* [Computer Vision-Algorithms&Applications(2010 draft)](https://heming-zhang.github.io/course/Computer_Vision-Algorithms&Applications(2010_draft).pdf)


## 1st Lecture
### Introduction
* why is this hard?
    * scale ambiguity
    * illuminant/surface color ambiguity
    * indirect reflection
    * observe super-position of multiple paths
    * variation in appearance
    * make sense of physical world from measurements of reflected light

* How does it work?
    * Broad Overview of many Vision Algorithm
    * Guessing? illusions

* History of CV

### This Course
* Syllabys Overview
    * image formation, reprensentation, and processing
    * Low level vision
        * photometric
        * geometric
        * motion
    * segementation and grouping
    * high level vision
        * using deep cnn

### The Pinhole Camera
* receive lights from many distinct points
* therefore, restrict lights and use sensor plane(get an inverted image)
* occuluder
